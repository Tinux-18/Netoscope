# Netoscope

## Overview

Netoscope is a image board where the user is able to upload an image
and comment on existing images.

The name was inspired by
[stereoscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy) as the page
aims to be a internet version of a
[Kaiser Panorama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy). If you
want to see a Kaiser Panorama in person, check it out at the
[Berlin Global Exposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy)
in Humbolt Forum.
