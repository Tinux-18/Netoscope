# Netoscope

## Overview

Netoscope is a image board where the user is able to upload an image and comment on existing images.

The name stems from [stereoscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy) as the page aims to be a internet version of a [Kaiser Panorama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy). If you want to see a Kaiser Panorama in person, check it out at the [Berlin Global Exposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy) in Humbolt Forum.
